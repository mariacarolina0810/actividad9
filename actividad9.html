                        <strong> Fox is common name for many species <br>
                            of carnivorous mammals belonging to the <br>
                            canidae famili.
                        </strong>
                    </u> Foxes are small to <br>
                    medium-sized canids (slightly smaller than <br>
                    the median-sized domestic dog), <br>
                    characterized by possessing a long narrow <br>
                    snout, and a bushy tail (or brush).

                        <strong>Members of about 37 species are referred <br>
                            to as foxes, of which only 12 species actually <br>
                            belong to the Vulpes genus of 'true foxes'.

                    </u> <br>
                    By far the most common and widespread species <br>
                    of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), although <br>
                    various species are found on almost every continent. <br> 
                    <br> The presence of fox-like carnivores all over the <br>
                    globe has led to their appearance in both popular <br> 
                    culture and folklore in many cultures around the <br>
                    world (see also Foxes in culture). The gray fox is <br>
                    one of only two canine species known to climb trees; <br>
                    the other is the raccoon dog.
